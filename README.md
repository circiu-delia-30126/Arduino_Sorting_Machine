The code is intended for an Arduino project that implements an automatic coin counter and displays relevant information on an LCD screen. It displays the current number of coins corresponding to two columns, in real-time. Each time a coin is inserted into the machine, the IR sensor detects the obstacle, and the count increases. At the same time, the buzzer activates, and a sound is heard (different for each type of coin). When the button is pressed, the total sum (in RON) that has been sorted will be displayed on the LCD. The potentiometer is used to adjust the brightness of the LCD.
